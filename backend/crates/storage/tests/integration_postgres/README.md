# Postgres integration tests (placeholder)

This directory is intentionally reserved for future Postgres-specific integration tests.

Planned usage:
- add tests here that validate Postgres-only behaviors
- gate execution behind `RUN_PG_TESTS=1`
- keep SQLite tests as the default fast/sandbox-safe path
